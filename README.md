# Modelling Attack and Defence on a Network-Geographic Topology

## 1 About

This directory contains a set of TeX files which, when compiled into a PDF, the paper **Modelling Attack and Defence on a Network-Geographic Topology**.

This article develops an attack-defence game model within a topological structure. We quote the abstract of the article below.

> This article provides a basic game theoretic model to investigate attack-defence situation on network and geographical topologies.
> The model is kept purposefully general in order to encapsulate the multitude of potential attacks and defence strategies. We illustrate the dynamics and characterise the resulting equilibrium of the basic attack-defence game. The equilibrium analysis concentrates on graph theoretic concepts of transversals and separators.
